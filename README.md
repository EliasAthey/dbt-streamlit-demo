# dbt-streamlit-demo
The dbt project uses two free snowflake marketplace datasets to generate san_francisco_census. This view provides zipcode-level census data for San Francisco for 2019 and 2020 (only partial data from one census table, but more could be incorportated).

The streamlit app visualizes san_francisco_census data with a basic chart of total population over the two years.
